                <h1><em>My Mission</em></h1>
                <h4><p>When I was growing up, My family and I would go from
                        apartment to apartment
                        not knowing when the next move would come. My parents
                        would work long hours to make ends meet
                        but would keep our family afloat through tough times.
                        Eventually, we made enough money to afford the down
                        payment on a house.
                        What my parents did not know was the consequences of
                        taking a loan and who to contact regarding the house. We
                        almost declared bankruptcy.
                        At the same time, my mother got word that her father had
                        passed away and she would come to inherit his 50% of his
                        wealth.
                        Using this money, we bought the house with cash and
                        still own the house to this day!
                    </p></h4>
                <br>
                <h4><p>I became a real estate agent to help families buy their
                        first home and to help them understand the full process
                        of buying a home! I explain everything about owning
                        house. Everything down to the last minute detail because
                        I do not want
                        another family to go through what my family went
                        through!
